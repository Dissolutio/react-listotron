# react-listotron
A very simple npm module, which outlines how to publish a React component to npm.

## In `package.json`:
You just need to update the following fields:
* name - set this to the name of your package as it will appear on npm, it should be the same name as your project folder
* description - a brief description of your package, this is optional so feel free to delete it if you prefer
* main - this points to the main entrypoint file for your React component, it matches the output filename created by webpack after it transpiles your ES6/JSX component into ES5 which is more widely supported by browsers

## In `webpack.config.js`:
* entry - change 'BoilerplateComponent.jsx' to the name of your main React component JSX file
* output > filename - change 'BoilerplateComponent.js' to the name of the transpiled ES5 version of your React component that is generated by webpack, this must match the "main" property in the package.json file above
IMPORTANT: Make sure you set output > libraryTarget to 'commonjs2'. This sets the "module.exports" property in the output file to your React component which is required for it to be used as an npm package.

Then just go into the project folder in a terminal, and run `npm install`, then `npm run build` (Babel will ES5-ify your `src/` into `lib/`, then if you want
to publish, `npm login` and then `npm publish`, just make sure you increment that version number in `package.json`
